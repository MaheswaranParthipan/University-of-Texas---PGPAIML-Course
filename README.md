# University-of-Texas---PGPAIML-Course

The projects and datasets for the PGPAIML course have been created using Google Colab, with a shared prefix in their names to simplify linking notebooks to their data sources.

Each of the Python Notebooks clearly defines the problem statement using Markdown text.

PGP-AIML-BA (Jan 2025 - Aug 2025), from Great Learning and the University of Texas, covers Projects for each of the following modules:

1.	Foundational Skills – Build a strong grounding in Python programming, data manipulation, and exploratory data analysis for AI/ML applications.
   
2.	Core Machine Learning – Learn supervised & unsupervised models including regression, decision trees, and clustering, with hands-on projects.
   
3.	Advanced ML Techniques – Master ensemble methods (bagging, boosting), model tuning, and optimisation to improve predictive performance.

4.	Deep Learning Foundations – Understand and implement neural networks, optimise architectures, and apply them to real-world use cases.

5.	Generative AI & NLP – Gain expertise in embeddings, transformers, large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation.
   
6.  Computer Vision – Explore image processing and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to solve vision-based AI problems.
   
7.	Deployment & Industry Readiness – Learn model deployment, containerization, and apply skills via hackathons and capstone projects, preparing for business-focused AI solutions.
