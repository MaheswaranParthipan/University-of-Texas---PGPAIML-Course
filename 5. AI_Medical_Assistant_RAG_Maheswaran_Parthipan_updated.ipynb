Sepsis can present with various clinical features, including fever or hypothermia, tachycardia or bradycardia, altered mental status, respiratory distress, and lactic acidosis.\\n2. Resuscitation: Provide adequate fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. The goal is to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mmHg and a central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) of greater than 70%.\\n3. Antibiotics: Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics as soon as possible based on the suspected source of infection and local microbiology data.\\n4. Source control: Identify and address the source of infection, if possible. This may involve surgical intervention or other interventions such as drainage or debridement.\\n5. Vasopressors: If adequate fluid resuscitation does not maintain adequate tissue perfusion, consider the use of vasopressors to maintain MAP.\\n6. Corticosteroids: Consider the use of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis who are not responding to initial resuscitative efforts.\\n7. Inotropes: Consider the use of inotropic agents to improve cardiac output and tissue perfusion.\\n8. Renal replacement therapy: Consider the use of renal replacement therapy in patients with sepsis who have acute kidney injury or who are not responding to other interventions.\\n9. Fluid management: Carefully manage fluid balance to avoid overload while maintaining adequate tissue perfusion.\\n10. Monitoring: Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status is essential for effective sepsis management in a critical care unit.\\n11.

Abdominal pain: The pain may start as a mild discomfort around the navel or in the lower right abdomen, which then gradually moves to the right lower quadrant and becomes more severe over time. The pain may be constant or intermittent and is often worsened by movement, coughing, or deep breathing.\\n2. Loss of appetite: People with appendicitis may lose their appetite due to abdominal pain and discomfort.\\n3. Nausea and vomiting: Vomiting is a common symptom of appendicitis, especially in the later stages of the condition.\\n4. Fever: A fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher may be present in some cases of appendicitis.\\n5. Constipation or diarrhea: Both constipation and diarrhea can occur with appendicitis, depending on the location and severity of the inflammation.\\n6. Rebound tenderness: This is a sign of inflammation in the abdomen. When pressure is applied to the abdomen, the pain worsens when the pressure is released.\\n7. Guarding: People with appendicitis may involuntarily contract their abdominal muscles to protect the affected area from further discomfort or injury.\\n\\nAppendicitis cannot be cured via medicine alone. Antibiotics may be used to treat any accompanying bacterial infection, but they do not address the underlying inflammation in the appendix. Surgery is the only effective treatment for appendicitis. The most common surgical procedure for treating appendicitis is an appendectomy, which involves removing the inflamed appendix through a small incision in the abdomen. This procedure can be performed as an open surgery or laparoscopically (using small incisions and a camera to guide the surgeon).

Some possible triggers for this condition include stress, genetics, viral infections, and certain medications.\\n\\nThere are several treatments that have been shown to be effective in addressing sudden patchy hair loss:\\n\\n1. Corticosteroids: These are anti-inflammatory drugs that can help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system's attack on the hair follicles. They can be applied topically or taken orally, depending on the severity of the condition.\\n2. Minoxidil: This is a medication that has been shown to promote hair growth in some people with alopecia areata. It works by increasing blood flow to the affected area and stimulating hair follicles to produce new hairs.\\n3. DHT blockers: Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a hormone that can contribute to hair loss. Some people with alopecia areata have high levels of DHT in their scalp. Finasteride and dutasteride are medications that can help block the production of DHT, which may help promote hair growth.\\n4. Immune system modulators: These drugs work by suppressing the immune system's attack on the hair follicles. Examples include methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine.\\n5. Hair transplantation: In some cases, hair transplantation may be an option for people with alopecia areata who have large bald patches that don't respond to other treatments. This involves taking healthy hair follicles from another part of the scalp or body and transplanting them into the affected area.\\n\\nIt's important to note that there is no cure for alopecia areata, and not all treatments work for everyone.

Acute care: In the immediate aftermath of a brain injury, the focus is on providing acute care to stabilize the patient's condition and prevent further damage. This may include measures such as controlling bleeding, managing seizures, maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and addressing any other medical complications that arise.\\n2. Rehabilitation: Once the acute phase has passed, rehabilitation becomes a key component of treatment for brain injury patients. Rehabilitation may involve a range of interventions aimed at helping the individual regain lost function and improve their overall quality of life. This may include physical therapy to address motor impairments, occupational therapy to help with activities of daily living, speech-language therapy to address communication difficulties, cognitive rehabilitation to address memory and attention problems, and psychological counseling to address emotional and behavioral issues.\\n3. Medications: Depending on the specific symptoms and impairments associated with a brain injury, various medications may be prescribed to help manage them. For example, anticonvulsants may be used to prevent seizures, anti-inflammatory drugs may be used to reduce swelling, and stimulant medications may be used to improve attention and focus.\\n4. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be recommended to address specific complications or impairments resulting from a brain injury. For example, surgical intervention may be necessary to remove hematomas or other lesions that are putting pressure on the brain, or to repair damaged blood vessels.\\n5. Alternative therapies: A variety of alternative therapies may also be recommended for individuals with brain injuries, depending on their specific needs and preferences. These may include approaches such as acupuncture, massage therapy, biofeedback, and mindfulness meditation, among others.\\n6.

Craniotomy, which involves removing a portion of the skull to relieve pressure on the brain, may also be recommended for severe TBIs.\\n5. Assistive devices: Depending on the extent of the injury, assistive devices such as wheelchairs, walkers, or braces may be necessary to help the person move around and perform daily activities.\\n6. Lifestyle modifications: Making lifestyle modifications can also be helpful in managing the symptoms of a TBI. This may include getting enough rest, eating a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol and drugs, and engaging in regular physical activity.\\n7. Support groups: Joining a support group can provide valuable emotional and social support for individuals with TBIs and their families. These groups offer a safe space to share experiences, learn from others, and connect with others who are going through similar challenges.\\n8\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":32}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Observation on Query 4:\n","\n","Answer 1, generated with a top_p of 0.95, allows the model to consider a wider range of possible next tokens, leading to slightly more diverse and expansive content.

Here are some necessary precautions and treatment steps for a person who has sustained a leg fracture while hiking:\\n1. Assess the situation: If you or someone in your group has sustained a leg fracture, the first step is to assess the situation. Check if there are any other injuries, such as head trauma or bleeding. If the fracture is open (compound), try to prevent contamination by covering it with a clean cloth.\\n2. Immobilize the leg: It's essential to immobilize the leg to prevent further damage and promote healing. Use a splint, a makeshift sling, or any available materials to keep the leg stable and in place. Be careful not to apply too much pressure on the fracture site.\\n3. Call for help: If possible, call for emergency medical assistance. If you're in a remote area without cell phone reception, try to signal for help using a mirror, whistle, or other means.\\n4. Provide first aid: While waiting for medical help, provide first aid by keeping the person warm and comfortable. Offer fluids to prevent dehydration and monitor their vital signs.\\n5. Transport the person: If you're unable to wait for medical assistance, try to transport the person carefully using a makeshift stretcher or carrying them on your back. Be sure to keep the leg immobilized during transportation.\\n6. Hospital treatment: Once in the hospital, the fracture will be diagnosed and treated using various methods such as casting, surgery, or traction. The person may also receive pain medication and physical therapy to help with recovery.\\n7. Recovery: Recovery from a leg fracture can take several weeks to months depending on the severity of the injury and the individual's overall health. During this time, it's essential to follow the doctor's instructions for care and rehabilitation. This may include using crutches or a walker, attending physical therapy sessions, and avoiding weight-bearing activities.\\n8. Prevention: To prevent leg fractures while hiking, wear appropriate footwear with good traction, avoid uneven terrain, and take breaks frequently to rest and stretch your legs. Additionally, carry a first aid kit and know basic first aid techniques in case of an emergency.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":33}],"source":["system_prompt2 = \"Answer the following question in detail\"\n","# Answer 1 generated, with the basic function defined with no modification of the LLM model's paramters\n","user_input = system_prompt2+\"\\n\"+ \"What are the necessary precautions and treatment steps for a person who has fractured their leg during a hiking trip, and what should be considered for their care and recovery?\"\n","response(user_input)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Answer 2 generated, with the modified function defined with all parameters being adjusted for better response\n","response_mod(user_input,1500,0,0.05,250)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":209},"id":"rCUORUv8-Yyp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751205547014,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":20030,"user":{"displayName":"Maheswaran P","userId":"09734200736253767152"}},"outputId":"4c735bba-d5f0-44b9-a787-afcc221aa302"},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Llama.generate: prefix-match hit\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"A fractured leg is a serious injury that requires immediate attention.

Check if the area is safe from further injury or danger, such as unstable terrain or inclement weather.\\n2. Call for help: If possible, call for emergency medical assistance. If there is no cell phone reception, use a satellite phone or hike out to find reception.\\n3. Immobilize the leg: Use a splint, a makeshift splint, or a tourniquet (if necessary) to immobilize the fractured leg. Be careful not to apply too much pressure on the tourniquet, as it can cause damage to the limb.\\n4. Control bleeding: Apply direct pressure to any visible wounds with a clean cloth to control bleeding.\\n5. Provide warmth and shelter: Keep the injured person warm and sheltered to prevent hypothermia.\\n6. Monitor vital signs: Check the injured person's pulse, breathing rate, and level of consciousness regularly.\\n7. Transportation: If possible, transport the injured person to a hospital as soon as possible. If hiking out is necessary, make sure the person is comfortable and well-supported during the journey.\\n8. Pain management: Provide pain relief using over-the-counter medications or prescription painkillers if available.\\n9. Follow-up care: Once the injured person has received medical attention, follow the doctor's instructions for recovery, which may include wearing a cast or brace, physical therapy, and avoiding weight-bearing activities.\\n10.

342. Clinical Decision Making\\nIntroduction\\nClinicians must integrate a huge variety of clinical data while facing conflicting pressures to decrease\\ndiagnostic uncertainty, risks to patients, and costs. Deciding what information to gather, which tests to\\norder, how to interpret and integrate this information to draw diagnostic conclusions, and which\\ntreatments to give is known as clinical decision making.\\nWhen presented with a patient, clinicians usually must answer the following questions:\\n• What disease does this patient have?\\n• Should this patient be treated?\\n• Should testing be done?\\nIn straightforward or common situations, clinicians often make such decisions informally; diagnoses are\\nmade by recognizing disease patterns, and testing and treatment are initiated based on customary\\npractice. For example, during a flu epidemic, a healthy adult who has had fever, aches, and harsh cough\\nfor 2 days is likely to be recognized as another case of influenza and provided only appropriate\\nsymptomatic relief. Such pattern recognition is efficient and easy to use but may be subject to error\\nbecause other diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities are not seriously or systematically considered. For\\nexample, a patient with that flu pattern and decreased O2 saturation might instead have bacterial\\npneumonia and require antibiotics. In more complex cases, a structured, quantitative, analytical\\nmethodology may be a better approach to decision making. Even when pattern recognition provides the\\nmost likely diagnostic possibility, analytic decision making is often used to confirm the diagnosis. Analytic\\nmethods may include application of the principles of evidence-based medicine, use of clinical guidelines,\\nand use of various specific quantitative techniques (eg, Bayes\\' theorem).\\nEvidence-Based Medicine and Clinical Guidelines\\nPhysicians have always felt that their decisions were based on evidence; thus, the current term\\n\"evidence-based medicine\" is somewhat of a misnomer. However, for many clinicians, the \"evidence\" is\\noften a vague combination of recollected strategies effective in previous patients, advice given by\\nmentors and colleagues, and a general impression of \"what is being done\" based on random journal\\narticles, abstracts, symposia, and advertisements. This kind of practice results in wide variations in\\nstrategies for diagnosing and managing similar conditions, even when strong evidence exists for favoring\\none particular strategy over another. Variations exist among different countries, different regions, different\\nhospitals, and even within individual group practices. These variations have led to a call for a more', metadata={'author': '', 'creationDate': 'D:20120615054440Z', 'creator': 'Atop CHM to PDF Converter', 'file_path': '/content/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'keywords': '', 'modDate': 'D:20250629042955Z', 'page': 3566, 'producer': 'pdf-lib (https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib)', 'source': '/content/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'subject': '', 'title': 'The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition', 'total_pages': 4114, 'trapped': ''}),\n"," Document(page_content='whose clinical characteristics (eg, demographics, comorbidities, clinical features) are similar to those of\\nthe patient group used to create the guideline. Furthermore, guidelines do not take into account the\\ndegree of uncertainty inherent in test results, the likelihood of treatment success, and the relative risks\\nand benefits of each course of action. To incorporate uncertainty and the value of outcomes into clinical\\ndecision making, clinicians must often apply the principles of quantitative or analytical medical decision\\nmaking.\\nClinical Decision-Making Strategies\\nOne of the most commonly used strategies for medical decision making mirrors the scientific method of\\nhypothesis generation followed by hypothesis testing. Diagnostic hypotheses are accepted or rejected\\nbased on testing.\\nHypothesis generation: Hypothesis generation involves the identification of the main diagnostic\\npossibilities (differential diagnosis) that might account for the patient\\'s clinical problem. The patient\\'s chief\\ncomplaint (eg, chest pain) and basic demographic data (age, sex, race) are the starting points for the\\ndifferential diagnosis, which is usually generated by pattern recognition. Each element on the list of\\npossibilities is ideally assigned an estimated probability (see Sidebar 342-1), or likelihood, of its being the\\ncorrect diagnosis (pre-test probability—see\\nTable 342-1).\\nClinicians often use vague terms such as \"highly likely,\" \"improbable,\" and \"cannot rule out\" to describe\\nthe likelihood of disease. Both clinicians and patients often misinterpret such semiquantitative terms;\\nexplicit statistical terminology should be used instead when available. Mathematical computations assist\\nclinical decision making and, even when exact numbers are unavailable, can better define clinical\\nprobabilities and narrow the list of hypothetical diseases further.\\nHypothesis testing: The initial differential diagnosis based on chief complaint and demographics is\\nusually very large, so the clinician first tests the hypothetical possibilities during the history and physical\\nexamination, asking questions or doing specific examinations that support or refute a suspected\\ndiagnosis. For instance, in a patient with chest pain, a history of leg pain and a swollen, tender leg\\ndetected during examination increases the probability of pulmonary embolism.\\nSidebar 342-1 Probability and Odds\\nThe probability of a disease (or event) occurring in a patient whose clinical information is unknown is the\\nfrequency with which that disease or event occurs in a population. Probabilities range from 0.0', metadata={'author': '', 'creationDate': 'D:20120615054440Z', 'creator': 'Atop CHM to PDF Converter', 'file_path': '/content/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'keywords': '', 'modDate': 'D:20250629042955Z', 'page': 3568, 'producer': 'pdf-lib (https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib)', 'source': '/content/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'subject': '', 'title': 'The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition', 'total_pages': 4114, 'trapped': ''}),\n"," Document(page_content='corresponds to the previously obtained probability of 25% (see Sidebar 342-1).\\nLimitations: Quantitative clinical decision making seems precise, but because many elements in the\\ncalculations are often imprecisely known (if they are known at all), this methodology is difficult to use in all\\nbut the most well-defined and studied clinical situations.\\nCognitive Errors in Clinical Decision Making\\nAlthough quantitative mathematical models can guide clinical decision making, clinicians rarely use formal\\ncomputations to make patient care decisions in day-to-day practice. Rather, an intuitive understanding of\\nprobabilities is combined with cognitive processes called heuristics to guide clinical judgment. Heuristics\\nare often referred to as rules of thumb, educated guesses, or mental shortcuts. Heuristics usually involve\\npattern recognition and rely on a subconscious integration of somewhat haphazardly gathered patient\\ndata with prior experience rather than on a conscious generation of a rigorous differential diagnosis that\\nis formally evaluated using specific data from the literature.\\nSuch informal reasoning is often fallible because heuristics may cause several types of unconscious\\nerrors (cognitive errors). Studies suggest that more medical errors involve cognitive error than lack of\\nknowledge or information.\\nTypes of cognitive error: There are many types of cognitive errors, and although it is obviously more\\nimportant to avoid errors than to properly classify them once made, being aware of common types of\\ncognitive errors can help clinicians recognize and avoid them.\\nCognitive errors may roughly be classified as those involving\\n• Faulty assessment of pre-test probability (overestimating or underestimating disease likelihood)\\n• Failure to seriously consider all relevant possibilities\\nBoth types of error can easily lead to improper testing (too much or too little) and missed diagnoses.\\nAvailability error occurs when clinicians misestimate the prior probability of disease because of recent\\nexperience. Experience often leads to overestimation of probability when there is memory of a case that\\nwas dramatic or that involved a patient who fared poorly or a lawsuit.

Altitude Sickness\\nAltitude sickness (AS) includes several related syndromes caused by decreased O2 availability\\nat high altitudes. Acute mountain sickness (AMS), the mildest form, is headache plus one or\\nmore systemic manifestations. High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is encephalopathy in\\npeople with AMS. High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a form of noncardiogenic\\npulmonary edema causing severe dyspnea and hypoxemia. AMS may occur in recreational\\nhikers and skiers in mountains. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment of mild AMS is with analgesics\\nand acetazolamide. Severe syndromes require descent and supplemental O2 if available. In\\naddition, dexamethasone may be useful for HACE, and nifedipine may be useful for HAPE.\\nAs altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases while the percentage of O2 in air remains\\nconstant; thus, the partial pressure of O2 decreases with altitude and, at 5800 m (19,000 ft), is about one\\nhalf that at sea level.\\nMost people can ascend to 1500 to 2000 m (5000 to 6500 ft) in one day without problems, but about 20%\\nof those who ascend to 2500 m (8000 ft) and 40% of those who ascend to 3000 m (10,000 ft) develop\\nsome form of AS. Rate of ascent, maximum altitude reached, and sleeping altitude influence the likelihood\\nof developing the disorder.\\nRisk factors: Effects of high altitude vary greatly among individuals. But generally, risk is increased by\\n• Going too high too fast\\n• Exertion\\nRisk is greater in people who have had previous AS and in those who live at low altitude (< 900 m [<\\n3000 ft]). Young children and young adults are probably more susceptible. Disorders such as diabetes,\\ncoronary artery disease, and mild COPD are not risk factors for AS, but hypoxia may adversely affect\\nthese disorders. Physical fitness is not protective.\\nPathophysiology\\nAcute hypoxia (eg, as occurs during rapid ascent to high altitude in an unpressurized aircraft) alters CNS\\nfunction within minutes. However, AS results from the body's neurohumoral and hemodynamic responses\\nto hypoxia and develops over hours to days.\", metadata={'author': '', 'creationDate': 'D:20120615054440Z', 'creator': 'Atop CHM to PDF Converter', 'file_path': '/content/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'keywords': '', 'modDate': 'D:20250629042955Z', 'page': 3469, 'producer': 'pdf-lib (https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib)', 'source': '/content/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'subject': '', 'title': 'The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition', 'total_pages': 4114, 'trapped': ''}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"appear to increase risk. HAPE is more common among men (unlike other forms of AS). Long-time high-\\naltitude residents can develop HAPE when they return after a brief stay at low altitude.\\nInitially, patients have dyspnea, decreased exertion tolerance, and dry cough. Pink or bloody sputum and\\nrespiratory distress are later findings. On examination, cyanosis, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low-grade\\nfever (< 38.5° C) are common. Focal or diffuse rales (sometimes audible without a stethoscope) are\\nusually present. HAPE may worsen rapidly; coma and death may occur within hours.\\nOther disorders: Peripheral and facial edema is common at high altitude.\\nHeadache, without other symptoms of AMS, is also common.\\nRetinal hemorrhages may develop at altitudes as low as 2700 m (9000 ft) and are common at > 5000 m\\n(> 16,000 ft). They are usually asymptomatic unless they occur in the macular region; they resolve rapidly\\nwithout sequelae.\\nPeople who have had radial keratotomy may have significant visual disturbances at altitudes > 5000 m (>\\n16,000 ft) or even as low as 3000 m (10,000 ft).
